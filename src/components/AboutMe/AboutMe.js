            I am a very confident learner who gets excited about creative problem solving journeys, especially if they include code.
            I have plunged into the full-stack of web development from HTML/CSS to servers and databases and many places in between. I am currently a TA for the UA Coding Bootcamp and I love building beautiful websites.
